# Troubleshooting RPC transaction forwarding

Follower nodes use `--rpc.forwarder` to submit transactions that cannot be propagated locally. A healthy follower can serve read-only JSON-RPC calls while transaction submission still fails if the configured forwarder cannot be reached by the execution-layer process.

This guide focuses on failures such as:

```text
error code -32603: error sending request for url (...)
```

and log messages around `eth_sendRawTransaction` forwarding.

## 1. Confirm the forwarder URL used by the node

The standard testnet configuration uses:

```sh
--rpc.forwarder https://rpc.quicknode.testnet.arc.network/
```

Check the actual process arguments rather than assuming the service file was reloaded:

```sh
ps -ef | grep '[a]rc-node-execution'
```

For systemd installations, also inspect the effective unit:

```sh
systemctl cat arc-execution
systemctl show arc-execution -p ExecStart
```

After changing a unit file, run `systemctl daemon-reload` before restarting the service.

## 2. Test JSON-RPC from the same host

A successful TCP or TLS connection alone does not prove that the upstream accepts JSON-RPC. Send a real request from the node host:

```sh
curl -sS -X POST https://rpc.quicknode.testnet.arc.network/ \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}'
```

For Arc Testnet the response should report chain ID `5042002` (`0x4cef52`).

If this request fails, fix DNS, routing, TLS, proxy, or firewall policy before debugging `arc-node-execution`.

## 3. Test from the execution process environment

Environment differences are common when `curl` works in an interactive shell but the systemd service fails. Inspect the service environment and proxy variables:

```sh
systemctl show arc-execution -p Environment
systemctl show arc-execution -p User -p Group
```

Pay particular attention to `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, and `SSL_CERT_DIR`. A service can have a different certificate store or proxy configuration than the login shell.

To reproduce the request under the same service account, run:

```sh
sudo -u "$(systemctl show -p User --value arc-execution)" \
  curl -sS -X POST https://rpc.quicknode.testnet.arc.network/ \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}'
```

If the unit does not set `User=`, run the check as the account that starts the node.

## 4. Enable targeted debug logs

Run the execution layer with debug logging for the RPC client while reproducing a single transaction submission:

```sh
RUST_LOG='info,rpc::eth=debug,alloy_rpc_client=debug' arc-node-execution node ...
```

With systemd, temporarily add the same `RUST_LOG` value to the service environment and restart it. Avoid enabling broad trace logging on a busy public RPC endpoint because it can produce a large amount of output.

Then submit one transaction and capture the log lines immediately before and after the forwarding failure:

```sh
journalctl -u arc-execution --since '2 minutes ago' --no-pager
```

## 5. Separate local RPC health from forwarding health

These checks answer different questions:

```sh
# Local execution-layer RPC is alive
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'

# Upstream forwarder is reachable and speaks the expected chain
curl -sS -X POST https://rpc.quicknode.testnet.arc.network/ \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_chainId","params":[],"id":1}'
```

A follower can pass the first check while failing the second. In that state, reads from the local verified chain can work even though `eth_sendRawTransaction` cannot be forwarded.

## 6. Information to include in a bug report

When the generic forwarding error remains after the checks above, include:

- `arc-node-execution --version` and the exact commit or release tag;
- operating system and architecture;
- the `--rpc.forwarder` URL with credentials or API keys removed;
- whether the JSON-RPC `eth_chainId` curl succeeds under the service account;
- the relevant `RUST_LOG` lines from `rpc::eth` and `alloy_rpc_client`;
- whether the node is started interactively, through systemd, or in Docker;
- proxy and custom CA usage, without including secrets.

Do not post private keys, bearer tokens, API keys, JWT secrets, or complete environment dumps containing credentials.
